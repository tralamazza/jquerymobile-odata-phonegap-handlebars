Testing: phonegap (device access), jquery mobile (ui), datajs (odata) and handlebars (templating).


* phonegap and datajs work as intended, which is awesome.

* jquery mobile has some neat features and simplicity, but for 2 things: hash routing and dynamic styling.

* handlebars is seriously amazing (fast and powerful).
